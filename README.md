# NU-Sustainability-and-Climate-Justice-Project
This repository contains the final capstone project for Northeastern University's Informatics Capstone course. The project focuses on creating a comprehensive dashboard to visualize data related to sustainability and climate justice initiatives at Northeastern University.

# Introduction
This capstone project involved collecting, analyzing, and visualizing data related to sustainability and climate justice initiatives at Northeastern University. Using advanced web scraping techniques, we gathered data from faculty web pages and scholarly databases to construct a narrative showcasing the university's commitment to these critical global challenges. The final product is an interactive dashboard that highlights academic and research contributions to sustainability, providing valuable insights for stakeholders.

# Project Goals
Web Crawler Development: Create a web crawler to extract detailed information from university web pages.
Interactive Dashboard Creation: Develop an interactive dashboard to present the collected data in an accessible and engaging format.
Digital Outreach Enhancement: Enhance the visibility of academic research related to sustainability, improving institutional rankings and stakeholder engagement.
Technical Tools and Frameworks
Selenium: Used for browser automation and data extraction from dynamic web pages.
R Language: Utilized for data cleaning and preprocessing.
Tableau: Used to create interactive and insightful dashboards.
Python: Employed for data collection, particularly from Google Scholar.
Project Outcomes

# Dashboard Overview
1. Sustainability and Climate Justice Dashboard NU Webpage:

Overview of Website Scraping: Displays the extent of data collection efforts from nine websites.
Options for Filtering: Interactive filters for college and keyword focus.
Faculty Members Across Institutions: Tree map visualization of faculty distribution.
Common Keywords Packed Bubbles: Visualizes keyword frequency using bubble sizes.
Keyword Distribution Histogram: Shows keyword distribution across colleges.
Frequency of Keywords Horizontal Bars: Analyzes keyword frequencies among universities.
Preliminary Findings from NU Faculty Webpage
Comparison of Faculty With and Without Keywords: Only 23% of faculty descriptions included sustainability-related keywords, indicating room for growth in this area.
Frequency of Sustainability Keywords Across Colleges: COE, COS, and CSSH colleges lead in mentioning sustainability keywords, showing widespread interest across disciplines.
Keyword Frequency Ranking from University Faculty Pages Crawl: Keywords like "Sustainability," "Environment," and "Climate Change" are most frequently mentioned, highlighting key research areas.
Top 20 Faculty Members by Keyword Frequency: Lists faculty members with the highest frequency of sustainability keyword mentions, emphasizing their research contributions.
NU Faculty Google Scholar Dashboard
Keyword vs. Metric: Analyzes keyword occurrences alongside metrics like the number of faculty, publications, and projects.
Entity vs. Keywords: Breaks down expertise by faculty members, showing keyword associations.
Time-Based Analysis: Tracks keyword trends over time, illustrating shifts in research focus.

# Insights Gained
Keyword Analysis: Identified prominent keywords and emerging research clusters.
Faculty Expertise: Mapped faculty expertise based on keyword associations.
Publication Trends: Analyzed trends in environmental research activity over time.
Reflections and Improvements
Web Crawling Challenges: Variations in HTML/CSS structures across departments required tailored data extraction approaches.
Ethical Considerations: Emphasized data confidentiality and the need for permissions when accessing and utilizing faculty information.
Dashboard Design: Future work should focus on creating more intuitive and interactive dashboards.
Keyword Analysis: Expanding and refining keyword analysis to align faculty research with teaching structures.


# Future Work
Enhanced Interactivity: Develop a more user-friendly and engaging dashboard.
Deeper Analysis: Conduct a more nuanced analysis of keyword trends and their relationship to faculty research interests.
Ethical Practices: Continue to uphold high ethical standards in data handling and analysis.
